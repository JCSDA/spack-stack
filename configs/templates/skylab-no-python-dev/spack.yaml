    # Note. This template is provided as a convenience for people who prefer to use
    # their own Python environments on top off non-Python libraries from spack-stack,
    # and as a workaround for people who have problems compiling the Python packages
    # in spack-stack on their system.
    # We do not recommend using this template, and we do not officially support it.
    # Use it at your own risk, and be aware that certain features may not work if
    # dependencies used by Python packages (e.g. netcdf-c used by py-netcdf) are
    # compiled with other options than what we need/what is in spack-stack. These
    # inconsistencies in redundantly provided libraries are the main reason why
    # spack builds those Python packages itself.

    # Virtual environment packages
    # Explicitly turn off Python in jedi-base-env,
    # this also requires removing jedi-ewok-env.
