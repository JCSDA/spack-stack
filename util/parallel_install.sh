#!/usr/bin/bash

# This script launches backgrounded instances of the 'spack install' command
# for an active Spack environment ($SPACK_ENV must be set). The first two
# arguments are required, specifying the number of instances and number of
# threads per instance, respectively. Remaining arguments are passed to the
# 'spack install' command. It is strongly recommended to only run this utility
# in a concretized environment. The script can be sourced so that the
# backgrounded jobs are associated with the current shell environment (strongly
# recommended when running inside a 'screen' or 'tmux' session).
#
# NOTE: If you are installing on a shared system (i.e., an HPC platform),
# especially if not running through a job scheduler with specified resources,
# be respectful of system resources and usage policies.
#
# *Depending on available resources*, for building the entire spack-stack
# unified environment, 2-4 instances with 4-8 cores each is generally
# reasonable. Six or more instances is generally overkill, as is more than 8
# cores per package build.
#
# Example usage:
#
#  % ../../utils/parallel_install.sh 2 6
# -or-
#  % . utils/parallel_install.sh 4 4 --fail-fast --verbose esmf
