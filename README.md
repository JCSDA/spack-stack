# spack-stack

spack-stack is a collaborative effort between the NOAA Environmental Modeling Center (EMC), the UCAR Joint Center for Satellite Data Assimilation (JCSDA), and the Earth Prediction Innovation Center (EPIC). spack-stack is designed to support the various applications of the supporting agencies such as the Unified Forecast System (UFS) or the Joint Effort for Data assimilation Integration (JEDI). The stack can be installed on a range of platforms, from Linux and macOS laptops to HPC systems, and comes pre-configured for many systems. Users can install the necessary packages for a particular application and later add the missing packages for another application without having to rebuild the entire stack.

[spack](https://github.com/spack/spack) is a community-supported, multi-platform, Python-based package manager originally developed by the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL; https://computing.llnl.gov/projects/spack-hpc-package-manager). It is provided as a submodule so that a stable version can be referenced. [See the Spack Documentation for more information](https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

spack-stack is mainly a collection of Spack configuration files, but provides a Spack extension to simplify the installation process:
- `spack stack create` is provided to copy common, site-specific, and application-specific configuration files into a coherent Spack environment and to create container recipes
- `spack stack setup-meta-modules` creates compiler, MPI and Python meta-modules for a convenient setup of a user environment using modules (lua and tcl)

spack-stack is maintained by:
- Kyle Gerheiser (@kgerheiser), NOAA-EMC
- Dom Heinzeller (@climbfuji), JCSDA
- not yet appointed, EPIC

Ready-to-use spack-stack installations are available on the following platforms:

For questions or problems, please consult the currently open [issues](https://github.com/noaa-emc/spack-stack/issues) and the [current and past discussions](https://github.com/noaa-emc/spack-stack/discussions) first.

**Note. spack-stack is in early development and not yet ready for use. Instructions may be incomplete or invalid.**

## Quickstart
```
git clone https://github.com/NOAA-EMC/spack-stack.git
cd spack-stack

# Ensure Python 3.7+ is available and the default before sourcing spack

# Sources Spack from submodule and sets ${SPACK_STACK_DIR}
source setup.sh

# Basic usage of create.py
spack stack create -h
```

### Create local environment
```
# See a list of sites and apps
spack stack create env -h

# Create a pre-configured Spack environment in envs/<app>.<site>
# (copies site-specific, application-specific, and common config files into the environment directory)
spack stack create env --site hera --app jedi-fv3 --name jedi-fv3.hera

# Activate the newly created environment
# Optional: decorate the command line prompt using -p
#     Note: in some cases, this can mess up long lines in bash
#     because color codes are not escaped correctly. In this
#     case, use export SPACK_COLOR='never' first.
spack env activate [-p] envs/jedi-fv3.hera

# Optionally edit config files (spack.yaml, packages.yaml compilers.yaml, site.yaml)
emacs envs/jedi-fv3.hera/spack.yaml
emacs envs/jedi-fv3.hera/common/*.yaml
emacs envs/jedi-fv3.hera/site/*.yaml

# Process the specs and install
# Note: both steps will take some time!
spack concretize
spack install

# Create lua module files
spack module lmod refresh

# Create meta-modules for compiler, mpi, python
spack stack setup-meta-modules
```

### Create container
```
# See a list of preconfigured containers
spack stack create container -h

# Create container spack definition (spack.yaml) in directory envs/<spec>.<config>
spack stack create container docker-ubuntu-gcc-openmpi --app ufs-weather-model

# Descend into container environment directory
cd envs/docker-ubuntu-gcc-openmpi.ufs-weather-model

# Optionally edit config file
emacs spack.yaml

# Docker: create Dockerfile and build container
# See section "container" in spack.yaml for additional information
spack containerize > Dockerfile
docker build -t myimage .
docker run -it myimage
```

## Generating new site config
Recommended: Start with an empty (default) site config. Then run `spack external find` to locate common external packages such as git, Perl, CMake, etc., and run `spack compiler find` to locate compilers in your path. Compilers or external packages with modules need to be added manually.
```
spack stack create env --site default --app jedi-ufs --name jedi-ufs.mysite

# Descend into site config directory
cd envs/jedi-ufs.mysite/site

# Find external packages and compilers, output the files here
# (overwrites packages.yaml and compilers.yaml)
SPACK_SYSTEM_CONFIG_PATH=`pwd` spack external find --all --scope system
SPACK_SYSTEM_CONFIG_PATH=`pwd` spack compiler find --scope system

# Optionally edit config files as above in the quickstart section

# Optionally attempt to find additional packages by name,
# for example: "spack external find wget"
```
It is also instructive to peruse the GitHub actions scripts in `.github/workflows` and `.github/actions` to see how automated spack-stack builds are configured for CI testing, as well as the existing site configs in `configs/sites`.

## Known issues

### General
1. First call to `spack concretize` fails with `[Errno 2] No such file or directory: ... .json`
This can happen when `spack concretize` is called the very first time in a new spack-stack clone, during which the boostrapping (installation of clingo) is done first. Simply rerunning the command should solve the problem.
