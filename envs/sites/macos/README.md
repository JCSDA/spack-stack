#### macOS

##### Prerequisites

- Setup of x86_64 environment on arch64 systems
- Install command line utilities
- Install homebrew for x86_64 environment

It is recommended to install the following prerequisites via Homebrew, as installing them with Spack and Apple's native clang can be tricky.
```
brew install gcc@11.2.0
brew install mpich@3.4.3
brew install python@3.8.9
brew install git@2.34.1
brew install git-lfs@3.0.2
