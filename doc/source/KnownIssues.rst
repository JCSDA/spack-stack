Known Issues
*******************************

==============================
General
==============================

1. First call to ``spack concretize`` fails with ``[Errno 2] No such file or directory: ... .json``

   This can happen when ``spack concretize`` is called the very first time in a new spack-stack clone, during which the boostrapping (installation of ``clingo``) is done first. Simply rerunning the command should solve the problem.

2. Build errors with Python 3.10

   There are several build errors with Python 3.10, for example Python packages being installed in nested subdirectories ``local`` of what is supposed to be the target installation directory. We therefore strongly recommend using Python 3.8 or 3.9.

==============================
NASA Discover
==============================

1. Timeout when fetching software during spack installs.

   Discover's connection to the outside world can be very slow and spack sometimes aborts with fetch timeouts. Try again until it works, sometimes have to wait for a bit.

==============================
NOAA Parallel Works
==============================

1. With the default module path, spack will detect the system as Cray, therefore one needs to remove it when building or using spack environments

2. ``libxml2`` won't untar during the ``spack install`` step, because of an issue with the filesystem. This can be avoided by making ``libxml2`` an external package

3. The ``/contrib`` filesystem can be very, very slow

==============================
NOAA RDHPCS Gaea
==============================

1. Random "permission denied" errors during the spack install phase

   If random errors during the spack install phase occur related to "permission denied" when building packages, edit ``envs/env_name/config.yaml`` and comment out the lines ``build_stage`` and ``test_stage``.

2. Random "git-lfs not found" errors during the spack install phase

   If random errors during the spack install phase occur related to "git-lfs not found" when building packages (e.g. crtm), simply load the module and try again (``module load git-lfs``).

==============================
macOS
==============================

1. Error `invalid argument '-fgnu89-inline' not allowed with 'C++'`

   This error occurs on macOS Monterey with ``mpich-3.4.3`` installed via Homebrew when trying to build the jedi bundles that use ``ecbuild``. The reason was that the C compiler flag ``-fgnu89-inline`` from ``/usr/local/Cellar/mpich/3.4.3/lib/pkgconfig/mpich.pc`` was added to the C++ compiler flags by ecbuild. The solution was to set ``CC=mpicc FC=mpif90 CXX=mpicxx`` when calling ``ecbuild`` for those bundles. Note that it is recommended to install ``mpich`` or ``openmpi`` with spack-stack, not with Homebrew.

2. Installation of ``poetry`` using ``pip3`` or test with ``python3`` fails

   This can happen when multiple versions of Python were installed with Homebrew and ``pip3``/``python3`` point to different versions. Run ``brew doctor`` and check if there are issues with Python not being properly linked. Follow the instructions given by ``brew``, if applicable.

3. Errors handling exceptions on macOS. A large number of errors related to handling exceptions thrown by applications was found when using default builds or Homebrew installations of ``mpich`` or ``openmpi``, which use flat namespaces. With our spack version, ``mpich`` and ``openmpi`` are installed with a ``+two_level_namespace`` option that fixes the problem.
