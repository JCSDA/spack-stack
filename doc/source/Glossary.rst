   JEDI
      A unified and versatile data assimilation (DA) system for Earth System Prediction, designed
      to readily accommodate new atmospheric and oceanic models and new observation systems. JEDI
      is developed and distributed by the Joint Center for Satellite Data Assimilation. It is also
      a community effort and external contributions are welcome. 

   JCSDA
      A multi-agency research center hosted by UCAR. JCSDA is dedicated to improving and accelerating
      the quantitative use of research and operational satellite data in weather, ocean, climate and
      environmental analysis and prediction systems.

   UFS
      A Unified Forecast System (UFS) is a community-based, coupled comprehensive Earth
      system modeling system. The UFS numerical applications span local to global domains
      and predictive time scales from sub-hourly analyses to seasonal predictions. It is
      designed to support the Weather Enterprise and to be the source system for NOAA's
      operational numerical weather prediction applications

   UFS Weather Model
      Global meduim-range, weather-prediction model previously known as NEMSfv3gfs or FV3GFS
      used to create forecasts.
