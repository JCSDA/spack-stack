**WORK IN PROGRESS**

This section will describe the environments (environment specs) defined in ``spack/var/spack/repos/jcsda-emc-bundles/packages`` and how to use them. It would be nice if we could automatically parse the directories in ``spack/var/spack/repos/jcsda-emc-bundles/packages`` to create a list here, using the docstring in the ``package.py`` files as descriptions of the environments.
