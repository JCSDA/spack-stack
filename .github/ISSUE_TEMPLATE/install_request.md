Note: Please search to see if an issue already exists for the software you are requesting to be installed.

**Which software in the stack would you like installed?**
Please provide the name of the software you would like installed on the HPCs.  Ensure the software exists in the list of supported software.  If new software needs to be added to the stack, use the [add_package_request.md](./add_package_request.md) template.

**What is the version/tag of the software?**
Please provide the version/tag of the software to be installed.

**What compilation options would you like set?**
Give a detailed list of compilation options, compiler and MPI flavors and versions, etc.

**Installation timeframe: Would you like this package to be installed in an upcoming quarterly spack-stack release, or sooner? If it is needed sooner (such as for testing a new package/version before incorporating it into a full release), please specify a preferred timeline and *one* machine on which you would like it to be installed for testing prior to the next spack-stack release.**
See the list of [supported HPC platforms](https://spack-stack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/PreConfiguredSites.html).

**Any other relevant information that we should know to correctly install the software??**
Please describe in as much detail as possible (such as whether there is currently a Spack recipe for this package).
