        **Note:** Requests for installations on WCOSS2 should not be made here, but instead at https://github.com/NOAA-EMC/WCOSS2-requests/issues. Typically, package installation requests for spack-stack (this form) should be used for installing packages for testing on R&D systems prior to requesting those packages on WCOSS2 (Cactus/Dogwood), but the WCOSS2 installation requests themselves should be submitted separately at the provided link.
